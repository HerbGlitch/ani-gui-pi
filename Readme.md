The goal of this program is to be able to watch shows on a raspberry pi zero and locally along with simple note and ratings built in. Currently the plan is to ssh into the raspberry pi zero and pass a video url to cvlc or to run mpv locally. This program will be able to search shows (similar to ani-cli) with ncurses as the tui and gtk as the gui.
